## Android Project - MVVM Architecture with Kotlin, Dagger-Hilt, Retrofit

**Description:**
Welcome to the GitHub repository of this Android project! Written in Kotlin, this project showcases the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It leverages powerful tools and libraries to deliver a robust and efficient solution.

**Key Features:**

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project adheres to the MVVM architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and facilitating code maintainability and testability.
- **Kotlin:** The entire project is written in Kotlin, a concise and expressive programming language that enhances developer productivity and code readability.
- **Dagger-Hilt:** Dependency injection is managed with Dagger-Hilt, an advanced dependency injection framework for Android. It simplifies dependency management and promotes modular and scalable code.
- **Retrofit:** Retrofit is utilized for making API calls and handling network requests. It offers a streamlined approach to interact with RESTful APIs. In this project, Retrofit is used to access the exchange rate data API available at [https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data/](https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data/).
- **Use Cases:** The project incorporates use cases, encapsulating business logic and providing reusable modules to handle specific tasks or operations.
- **Android Support:** The project targets the latest Android SDK version and adheres to best practices, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across a wide range of Android devices.

To run a demo of the project, you don't need to create another API KEY. The project uses an API KEY stored in the `local.properties` file.

In a real project scenario, it is crucial to exclude the `local.properties` file from version control to protect sensitive information such as API keys. It is recommended to add the `local.properties` file to the `.gitignore` file to ensure it is not accidentally committed to the repository.
